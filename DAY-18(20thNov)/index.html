    <h2>Topics: CSS Positions</h2>
    <p>There are five different position values:

        <ul>
            <li>static</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Default position for any element</li>
            </ul>
            <li>relative</li>
            <ul>
                <li>position: relative</li>
                <li>changing the values in the properties:top, left, right, bottom; will change the position with respect to the currrent position</li>
            </ul>
            <li>absolute</li>
            <ul>
                <li>position: absolute</li>
                <li>by applying this style the element directly goes to its ancestor i.e.,the viewport(default device-width)</li>
                <li>changing the values in the properties:top, left, right, bottom; will change the position with respect to the viewport</li>
            </ul>
            <li>sticky</li>
            <ul>
                <li>tomorrow</li>
            </ul>
            <li>fixed</li>
            <ul>
                <li>position: fixed</li>
                <li>it makes the element fixed on a particular place irrespective of other elements</li>
            </ul>
        </ul> 
    </p>
    <p>After applying specific position(other than static), we can further change the position using left, right, top, bottom properties.
        Here, top has more priority than bottom. Similarly left has more priority than right.
        However, these properties work for only positioned elements i.e., elements whose position is other than static.
    </p>
    <p>Using Positions for elements may result in overlapping. z-index property is used to give the priority. Higher the value, higher the priority,</p>
